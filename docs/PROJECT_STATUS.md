# Enliterator Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-06 (Evening Update)

## 📊 Status Summary

- **Pipeline Stages**: 100% COMPLETE (8 of 8) ✅
- **OpenAI Integration**: Phase 2 COMPLETE ✅
- **Admin UI**: DEPLOYED ✅
- **Fine-Tune Services**: IMPLEMENTED ✅
- **Literate Interface**: 0% COMPLETE ❌
- **Production Ready**: NO - MISSING CORE USER INTERFACE 🚨

Enliterator is a Rails 8 application that transforms dropped data collections into **Enliterated Knowledge Navigators (EKNs)** - conversational interfaces to your data, like Apple's 1987 Knowledge Navigator vision but for any dataset.

**CRITICAL**: The pipeline is complete but the product isn't usable. We built the engine but not the car. Users need a conversational interface to create and interact with their EKNs. See [LITERATE_INTERFACE_MISSING.md](./LITERATE_INTERFACE_MISSING.md) for details.

## Pipeline Implementation Progress

### ✅ Recently Completed (2025-08-06)

#### OpenAI Integration Overhaul (Issue #47)
**Status**: Phase 2 COMPLETE ✅

**Phase 1 (Previously Completed)**:
- Settings Management System with database-backed configuration
- Admin UI at https://e.dev.domt.app/admin
- Base extraction service with correct OpenAI::Helpers::StructuredOutput::BaseModel
- Lexicon::TermExtractionService refactored

**Phase 2 (Completed Today)**:
- ✅ Refactored pools/entity_extraction_service.rb to use BaseExtractionService
- ✅ Refactored pools/relation_extraction_service.rb to use BaseExtractionService
- ✅ Refactored mcp/extract_and_link_service.rb with proper response models
- ✅ Implemented FineTune::DatasetBuilder (Issue #26) - generates JSONL from knowledge graph
- ✅ Implemented FineTune::Trainer (Issue #27) - manages OpenAI fine-tuning jobs
- ✅ Fixed Lexicon Bootstrap timeout with batching and parallel processing
- ✅ Verified remaining services don't need refactoring (use different APIs or no OpenAI)

### 🚀 Next Steps - Build the Literate Interface!

#### CRITICAL Priority: Create the Conversational Interface (Issue #49)
1. **Build user-facing chat interface**
   - Natural language conversation UI (not admin panel)
   - Onboarding flow that explains Enliterator conversationally
   - Guide users through creating their first EKN
   - Real Knowledge Navigator experience (like Apple's 1987 vision)

2. **Implement literate process narration**
   - Conversational updates during pipeline processing
   - Natural explanations of what's being discovered
   - Story-telling from the emerging knowledge graph
   - Error handling in plain language

3. **Connect literate layer to technical foundation**
   - Literate interface → Routing model → Pipeline
   - Natural language wrappers for MCP tools
   - Conversational access to knowledge graphs
   - Story generation from graph paths

#### THEN: Create First Production EKN
1. **Use Enliterator's Knowledge Navigator to process itself**
   - Meta-enliteration guided by conversation
   - Navigator explains what it's finding in the codebase
   - Creates Enliterator's own EKN

#### Previous "Secondary" Priorities (Actually Core)
- MCP Server Implementation WITH conversational wrappers
- Dialogue system (this IS the product, not an enhancement!)
- Knowledge exploration through natural language
- Production deployment of the conversational interface

## Key Technical Components
