# Stage 9: Knowledge Navigator - IN PROGRESS (~30% Complete)

**Status**: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE - We have a chat interface, NOT a Knowledge Navigator
**Started**: 2025-08-06
**Reality Check**: The Navigator vision requires SHOWING data through dynamic visualizations, not just chatting about it

## What a Knowledge Navigator Actually Is

Based on Apple's 1987 vision and the Enliterator spec, a Knowledge Navigator must:
1. **Present information visually** - Not just text responses
2. **Enable direct manipulation** - Click, drag, zoom, filter
3. **Generate appropriate UI dynamically** - Charts for stats, timelines for history, graphs for relationships
4. **Speak and listen** - Full voice interaction
5. **Export and share** - Save visualizations, generate reports

## Current State: Basic Chat Interface (30%)

### ✅ What We Have:
- Text-based chat interface
- Fine-tuned model that understands the domain
- Database-backed conversation history
- Graph queries that return entity names
- Structured output responses

### ❌ What's Missing (70%):

#### 1. Dynamic UI Generation (0% done)
**Required**: Service that detects conversation patterns and generates appropriate visualizations
- Pattern: "show me the relationships" → Network graph
- Pattern: "compare X and Y" → Comparison chart
- Pattern: "timeline of events" → Interactive timeline
- Pattern: "where is X located" → Map view

**Implementation needed**:
```ruby
# app/services/navigator/ui_generator.rb
class UiGenerator
  def analyze_intent(text) # Detect visualization needs
  def generate_component(type, data) # Create React/Stimulus component
  def render_visualization(component) # Inject into conversation
end
```

#### 2. Visualization Components (0% done)
**Required**: Actual visual components to display data
- **NetworkGraph**: D3.js force-directed graph for entities/relationships
- **Timeline**: Interactive temporal visualization
- **DataTable**: Sortable, filterable, exportable tables
- **EntityCard**: Rich information panels with actions
- **ComparisonChart**: Bar/line/pie charts for metrics
- **MapView**: Leaflet integration for spatial data

#### 3. Voice Interaction (0% done)
**Required**: Web Speech API integration
- Speech-to-text for input (browser API exists)
- Text-to-speech for responses (needs synthesis)
- Voice commands for navigation ("show me more", "go back")

#### 4. Interactive Navigation (0% done)
**Required**: Direct manipulation of data
- Click entities to expand details
- Drag to rearrange graph layouts
- Zoom in/out of visualizations
- Filter by properties/time/type
- Export visualizations as images/PDFs

#### 5. Context-Aware UI (0% done)
**Required**: UI that adapts to conversation context
- Persistent sidebar with current entities
- Breadcrumb trail of navigation
- Related suggestions based on current view
- History of generated visualizations

## Technical Requirements Not Yet Implemented

### Frontend Architecture Needed:
```javascript
// app/javascript/navigator/visualization_manager.js
class VisualizationManager {
  constructor() {
    this.activeVisualizations = new Map();
    this.d3 = require('d3');
  }
  
  renderNetworkGraph(entities, relationships) { /* D3 implementation */ }
  renderTimeline(events) { /* Timeline.js implementation */ }
  renderDataTable(data) { /* DataTables implementation */ }
  renderMap(locations) { /* Leaflet implementation */ }
}
```

### Backend Services Needed:
```ruby
# app/services/navigator/intent_to_ui_service.rb
# Maps natural language to UI components

# app/services/navigator/data_formatter_service.rb  
# Formats graph data for visualization libraries

# app/services/navigator/export_service.rb
# Generates PDFs, images, CSVs from visualizations
```

### Database Schema Needed:
```ruby
# Visualization states and preferences
create_table :visualization_states do |t|
  t.string :conversation_id
  t.string :component_type
  t.jsonb :configuration
  t.jsonb :data
  t.integer :position
end
```

## Honest TODO List for Completion

### Phase 1: Visualization Foundation (Next 2 weeks)
- [ ] Install D3.js, Timeline.js, Leaflet, DataTables
- [ ] Create VisualizationManager JavaScript class
- [ ] Build first NetworkGraph component
- [ ] Implement intent-to-UI pattern detection
- [ ] Add visualization injection to conversation flow

### Phase 2: Core Visualizations (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Timeline component for temporal data
- [ ] DataTable with sorting/filtering
- [ ] Comparison charts (bar, line, pie)
- [ ] Entity detail cards
- [ ] Relationship explorer

### Phase 3: Interactivity (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Click handlers for all visualizations
- [ ] Drag-and-drop for graph layouts
- [ ] Zoom/pan controls
- [ ] Filter panels
- [ ] Export functionality

### Phase 4: Voice & Polish (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Web Speech API integration
- [ ] Voice command processing
- [ ] Text-to-speech synthesis
- [ ] Accessibility features
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Success Criteria

Stage 9 will be ACTUALLY complete when:
1. User says "show me how X relates to Y" and sees an interactive graph
2. User says "timeline of events" and sees a visual timeline
3. User can click any entity to explore it further
4. User can export any visualization as PDF/image
5. User can navigate by voice
6. The interface feels like a "Knowledge Navigator" not a chatbot

## Current Reality

**We have**: A functional chat interface that talks about data
**We need**: A Knowledge Navigator that SHOWS and lets users INTERACT with data

**Completion**: ~30%
**Remaining work**: 70% - All the actual "Navigator" parts

## Files That Claim Completion (Need Updates)

- ~~`/docs/STAGE_9_COMPLETE.md`~~ → Renamed to `STAGE_9_IN_PROGRESS.md` (this file)
- `/docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` → Updated to show 30% complete
- `/CLAUDE.md` → Needs update to remove "Stage 9 COMPLETE" claims

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Stop claiming completion** - Update all documentation
2. **Install visualization libraries** - D3.js, etc.
3. **Build first visual component** - Start with NetworkGraph
4. **Connect to conversation** - Detect "show relationships" intent
5. **Test with real data** - Display actual graph entities visually

*Let's be honest: We built a chat interface. The Knowledge Navigator vision requires much more.*
