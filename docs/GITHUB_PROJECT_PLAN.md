2. **Test-driven**: Write tests before implementation
3. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize from the start
4. **Documentation**: Keep CLAUDE.md and API docs current

### Code Standards
- Follow Rails conventions
- Use service objects for business logic
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add performance metrics to critical paths

### Review Checklist
