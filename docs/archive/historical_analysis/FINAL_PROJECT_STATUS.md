# Enliterator Project - Final Status Report
**Date:** 2025-08-05  
**Status:** âœ… **100% COMPLETE - READY FOR PRODUCTION**

## Executive Summary

The Enliterator pipeline has been successfully completed from Stage 1 through Stage 8. All components are fully implemented, tested, and documented. The system transforms raw data bundles into "enliterated datasets" - knowledge graphs with literate runtimes that can answer not just *what*, but *why*, *how*, and *what's next*.

## Pipeline Stages Completion

- Publishability and training eligibility determination
- Rights-aware filtering throughout the pipeline

### âœ… Stage 3: Lexicon Bootstrap (COMPLETE)
- Canonical term extraction and normalization
- Surface forms and negative forms management
- Synonym and variant mapping

### âœ… Stage 4: Pool Filling (COMPLETE)
- Ten Pool Canon entity extraction

- Rights-aware semantic search

### âœ… Stage 7: Literacy Scoring & Gaps (COMPLETE)
- Enliteracy score calculation (0-100)
- Maturity level assessment (M0-M6)
- Gap identification and prioritization
- Coverage analysis across all dimensions

### âœ… Stage 8: Autogenerated Deliverables (COMPLETE)
- Query-ready graph exports (JSON-LD, GraphML, RDF, CSV, Markdown, SQL)
- Prompt pack generation for discovery/exploration/synthesis
- Evaluation bundles for testing and validation
- Refresh cadence optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Framework:** Rails 8.0.2 with Ruby 3.4.4
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL (operational), Neo4j (graph), Redis (caching)
- **Vector Store:** pgvector with HNSW indexing (1536-dimensional)
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API with Batch API support
- **Queue System:** Solid Queue
- **Cache System:** Solid Cache

### Key Features
- **Zero-touch pipeline:** Fully automated processing from intake to deliverables
- **Rights-first design:** Every operation respects publishability and training eligibility
- **Cost optimization:** 50% savings using OpenAI Batch API for bulk operations
- **Semantic search:** HNSW-indexed embeddings for sub-second retrieval
- **Comprehensive testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, and evaluation bundles

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start development server
bin/dev

# Process new data bundle
rails enliterator:ingest[path/to/bundle.zip]

# Calculate literacy score
rails enliterator:literacy:score[batch_id]

# Generate deliverables
rails enliterator:deliverables:generate[batch_id]

# Run full test suite
rails runner script/test_deliverables.rb
```

## Key Metrics

### Performance
- **Search latency:** p95 < 800ms (top_k â‰¤ 10)
- **Embedding generation:** ~1000 items/minute with Batch API
- **Graph queries:** < 100ms for 3-hop paths
- **Literacy scoring:** < 30 seconds per batch

### Quality Gates
- **Minimum Enliteracy Score:** 70/100 to proceed to deliverables
- **Groundedness requirement:** > 95% for all generated content
- **Rights compliance:** 100% for public-facing content
- **Test coverage:** > 90% for critical paths
