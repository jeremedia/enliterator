# Enliterator Progress Summary

## Completed âœ…

### 1. Foundation & Infrastructure
- Rails 8 application initialized with PostgreSQL
- Docker Compose configured with all services:
  - PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
  - Redis for caching
  - Neo4j for knowledge graph
  - MinIO for S3-compatible storage
- Solid Queue, Cache, and Cable configured
- Environment configuration (.env.example)

### 2. OpenAI Integration
- Official OpenAI Ruby gem v0.16.0 configured
- Responses API with Structured Outputs emphasized
- Example MCP service (ExtractAndLinkService) demonstrating proper usage
- Models configured to use gpt-4o-2024-08-06 (supports structured outputs)

### 3. Core Data Models
- Database migrations created for all Ten Pool Canon:
  - ProvenanceAndRights (with consent/license enums)
  - Idea, Manifest, Experience
  - Relational, Evolutionary, Practical, Emanation
  - Lexicon and Ontology
  - Intent and Task
- Join tables for pool relationships
- PgSearch integration for full-text search

### 4. Model Implementation (Partial)
- ProvenanceAndRights model with rights derivation logic
- Idea model with relationships and graph sync
- Manifest model with temporal tracking
- Experience model with privacy features
- Concerns: HasRights, TimeTrackable

### 5. Service Architecture
- ApplicationService base class
- Service modules created (ingest/, rights/, lexicon/, etc.)
- Example MCP service with structured outputs

### 6. Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md
- Updated CLAUDE.md with Responses API requirements
- GitHub project plan with 10 milestones and 41 issues
- Progress tracking with todo list

## Recently Completed âœ…

### Ten Pool Canon Models
- All 10 core models implemented with spec-compliant fields
- Join table models created for associations
- Model validations and callbacks working
- Test suite verifies creation and associations
- Relational model updated to use only spec-defined verbs

## In Progress ðŸš§

### Current Focus: Pipeline Infrastructure
- Need to fix IntentAndTask status field issue
- Set up Solid Queue job infrastructure
- Begin Stage 1: Intake System implementation

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

### Immediate Priority
1. Run database migrations
2. Complete model implementations
3. Create Solid Queue job infrastructure
4. Implement Stage 1: Intake System

### Pipeline Implementation
1. Create job base classes
2. Implement file processing
3. Rights inference system
4. Entity extraction with OpenAI

### MCP Server
1. Create API endpoints
2. Implement all tools
3. Request validation
4. Audit logging

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Using official OpenAI gem** with Responses API for reliable structured outputs
2. **PostgreSQL multi-database** setup for Solid Queue/Cache/Cable
3. **Direct Neo4j driver** instead of ActiveGraph OGM
4. **Rights-first design** with every entity having provenance
5. **Comprehensive indexing** for performance

## Technical Stack
- Rails 8.0.2
- Ruby 3.4.4
- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector
- Neo4j 5 Community
- Redis 7
- OpenAI API (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14 and gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14)

## Commands to Continue

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Run migrations
bin/rails db:create db:migrate

# Start development server
bin/dev

# Run tests (when created)

```

## GitHub Issues to Create

When repository is available, create issues for:
1. Complete model implementations
2. Set up RSpec testing framework
3. Implement pipeline Stage 1: Intake
4. Create MCP server endpoints
5. Implement entity extraction
6. Set up CI/CD pipeline
