# OpenAI Integration Overhaul - Phase 2 Complete

**Completion Date**: 2025-08-06 (Updated)  
**GitHub Issue**: #47  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: NO HARDCODED OPENAI CONFIGURATIONS

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: There must be NO hardcoded OpenAI model names, versions, or configurations anywhere in the codebase. All OpenAI settings MUST:
1. Use `OpenaiConfig::SettingsManager` for model selection
2. Be configurable via the Admin UI (https://e.dev.domt.app/admin)
3. Fall back to database settings, then ENV variables, NEVER hardcoded strings
4. Use the `refresh_available_models!` method to get current models from the API

**Current Models (August 2025)**:
- `gpt-4.1` - Latest GPT-4.1 for extraction and answers
- `gpt-4.1-mini` - Mini model for fine-tuning
- `gpt-4.1-nano` - Ultra-fast nano model for routing
- NOT `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` (over a year old!)
- NOT `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` (over a year old!)

## Executive Summary

The OpenAI Integration Overhaul has been successfully completed. All extraction services now use the official OpenAI Ruby gem v0.16.0 with the Responses API and Structured Outputs. The deprecated `chat.completions.create` pattern has been replaced throughout the codebase, and new fine-tuning capabilities have been implemented.

## What Was Completed

### Phase 1 (Previously Completed)

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Database-backed settings management system
   - Admin UI deployed at https://e.dev.domt.app/admin
   - OpenaiConfig::BaseExtractionService established as the pattern
   - OpenaiSetting, PromptTemplate, FineTuneJob models created

2. **Reference Implementation**
   - Lexicon::TermExtractionService refactored as the reference
   - Demonstrated correct use of OpenAI::Helpers::StructuredOutput::BaseModel

### Phase 2 (Completed 2025-08-06)

1. **Service Refactoring (4 services)**
   - ✅ `Pools::EntityExtractionService` - Now inherits from BaseExtractionService
   - ✅ `Pools::RelationExtractionService` - Fully refactored with proper response models
   - ✅ `MCP::ExtractAndLinkService` - Complete refactor including new response model classes
   - ✅ `Lexicon::TermExtractionService` - Reference implementation maintained

2. **Services Analyzed (no refactoring needed)**
   - `Literate::Engine` - Uses chat API for conversational responses (not extraction)
   - `Interview::Engine` - Doesn't use OpenAI at all
   - `Deliverables::PromptPackGenerator` - No OpenAI usage
   - `Literacy::EnliteracyScorer` - No OpenAI usage
   - Embedding services - Use embeddings API, not completions

3. **New Implementations**
   - ✅ **FineTune::DatasetBuilder** (Issue #26)
     - Generates JSONL training data from knowledge graph
     - Supports 6 task types: canon_map, path_text, route, normalize, rights_style, gap_awareness
     - Automatic train/val/test split (80/10/10)
     - Neo4j integration for path extraction
     - Rights-aware data selection

   - ✅ **FineTune::Trainer** (Issue #27)
     - Manages OpenAI fine-tuning jobs
     - File upload and job creation
     - Status monitoring and event tracking
     - Model deployment support
     - Database integration for job records

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - ✅ **Lexicon::BootstrapJob** - Fixed timeout issue
     - Added batch processing (10 items per batch)
     - Implemented parallel processing with threads
     - Thread-safe term collection with Mutex
     - 30-second timeout per thread to prevent hanging

## Technical Implementation Details

### Correct Pattern (Now Used Throughout)

```ruby
# Response model using the CORRECT base class
class YourResponseClass < OpenAI::Helpers::StructuredOutput::BaseModel
  required :field_name, String
  required :pool, OpenAI::EnumOf[:idea, :manifest, :experience]
end

# Service inheriting from base
class YourService < OpenaiConfig::BaseExtractionService
  def call
    super
  end
  
  protected
  
  def response_model_class
    YourResponseClass
  end
  
  def transform_result(parsed_result)
    # Transform the structured response
  end
end
```

### Deprecated Pattern (Removed)

```ruby
# OLD - DO NOT USE
OPENAI.chat.completions.create(
  messages: messages,
  model: "gpt-4",
  response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: {...} }
)
```

## Key Achievements

1. **Consistency**: All extraction services now follow the same pattern
2. **Reliability**: Structured Outputs guarantee schema compliance
3. **Maintainability**: Settings managed via admin UI, not hardcoded
4. **Performance**: Batch processing prevents timeouts
5. **Completeness**: Fine-tuning pipeline ready for EKN creation

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify no deprecated patterns remain
grep -r "chat.completions" app/services/
# Should return only literate/engine.rb (conversational, not extraction)

# Check for correct base model usage
grep -r "OpenAI::Helpers::StructuredOutput::BaseModel" app/services/
# Should show all response model classes

# Test refactored services
rails console
service = Pools::EntityExtractionService.new(content: "test content")
result = service.call
puts result[:success]

# Test fine-tune dataset generation
builder = FineTune::DatasetBuilder.new(batch_id: 1)
result = builder.call
puts result[:metadata]
```

## Impact on Project

### Immediate Benefits
- System is now ready for meta-enliteration
- Can generate training data from knowledge graph
- Can fine-tune models for literate behavior
- Reduced API costs with batch processing
- Better error handling and recovery

### Unblocked Capabilities
- EKN (Enliterated Knowledge Navigator) creation
- Production deployment
- Scalable processing of large datasets
- Reliable structured data extraction

## Next Steps

1. **Run Meta-Enliteration**
   ```bash
   rails enliterator:ingest[/Volumes/jer4TBv3/enliterator]
   ```

2. **Generate Fine-Tune Dataset**
   ```bash
   rails runner "FineTune::DatasetBuilder.new(batch_id: 1).call"
   ```

3. **Train EKN Model**
   ```bash
   rails runner "FineTune::Trainer.new(dataset_path: 'path/to/train.jsonl').call"
   ```

## Files Modified

### Services Refactored
- `app/services/pools/entity_extraction_service.rb`
- `app/services/pools/relation_extraction_service.rb`
- `app/services/mcp/extract_and_link_service.rb`

### New Services Created
- `app/services/fine_tune/dataset_builder.rb`
- `app/services/fine_tune/trainer.rb`

### Jobs Updated
- `app/jobs/lexicon/bootstrap_job.rb`

## Issues Resolved

- ✅ Issue #47: OpenAI Integration Overhaul
- ✅ Issue #26: Fine-tune Dataset Generation
- ✅ Issue #27: OpenAI Fine-tuning Integration
- ✅ Issue #42: Refactor to OpenAI::BaseModel (partial)
- ✅ Lexicon bootstrap timeout (183 files)

## Conclusion

The OpenAI Integration Overhaul is complete. The system now uses modern, supported patterns throughout, with proper error handling, database-backed configuration, and a complete fine-tuning pipeline. The Enliterator is ready to create its first Enliterated Knowledge Navigator through meta-enliteration.
