# Stage 7: Literacy Scoring & Gaps - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Stage 7 implements comprehensive literacy scoring and gap analysis for the Enliterator knowledge graph. This stage evaluates the completeness and quality of the data, identifies gaps, and produces an "Enliteracy Score" that measures how well the dataset can converse about its content.

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE  
**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Minimum Score Required**: 70/100 to proceed to Stage 8

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Services (`app/services/literacy/`)

#### CoverageAnalyzer
- Analyzes idea coverage (% of manifest/experience linked to ideas)
- Calculates relationship density (edges per node)
- Measures path completeness (traces from ideas to manifestations)
- Evaluates temporal coverage (% with valid time fields)
- Assesses spatial coverage (% of manifest with location data)
- Analyzes pool distribution and balance

#### MaturityAssessor
- Determines maturity levels (M0-M6)
- M0: Raw intake only
- M1: Rights assigned
- M2: Lexicon extracted
- M3: Entities identified
- M4: Graph assembled
- M5: Embeddings complete
- M6: Fully literate (score â‰¥70)
- Tracks progress and identifies blockers

#### GapIdentifier
- Finds orphaned entities (no relationships)
- Identifies missing canonical names
- Detects ambiguous rights
- Locates sparse relationship areas
- Discovers temporal gaps in coverage
- Finds missing embeddings
- Prioritizes gaps by severity and impact

#### EnliteracyScorer
- Calculates composite Enliteracy Score (0-100)
- Weighted scoring:
  - Coverage: 40%
  - Relationships: 30%
  - Rights: 20%
  - Retrieval: 10%
- Generates recommendations for improvement
- Produces comprehensive reports
- Determines readiness for Stage 8

### 2. Orchestration (`app/jobs/literacy/`)

#### ScoringJob
- Orchestrates all literacy services
- Runs complete analysis pipeline
- Updates batch metadata with results
- Handles errors gracefully
- Supports configurable options:
  - save_results: Persist reports to disk
  - notify: Send completion notifications
  - generate_report: Create full report

### 3. Rake Tasks (`lib/tasks/enliterator.rake`)

```bash
# Calculate literacy score
rails enliterator:literacy:score[batch_id]

# Generate gap report
rails enliterator:literacy:gaps[batch_id]

# Create full literacy report
rails enliterator:literacy:report[batch_id]

# Check maturity level
rails enliterator:literacy:maturity[batch_id]
```

### 4. Test Suite (`script/test_literacy_scoring.rb`)

Comprehensive test script that validates:
- All service components
- Scoring calculations
- Gap identification
- Report generation
- Rake task execution
- Prerequisites from Stages 1-6

### Scoring Thresholds

- **â‰¥70**: Ready for Stage 8 (Autogenerated Deliverables)
- **50-69**: Moderate gaps, improvement needed
- **30-49**: Significant gaps, major work required
- **<30**: Critical gaps, fundamental issues

### Gap Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Must be addressed immediately
- **High**: Should be addressed before production
- **Medium**: Important for quality
- **Low**: Nice to have improvements
- **Minimal**: Minor optimizations

## Usage Examples

### 1. Run Complete Scoring

```bash
# Run full literacy scoring for a batch
rails enliterator:literacy:score[batch_123]

# Output:
ðŸ“Š ENLITERACY SCORE: 75.3/100
   Status: âœ… PASS
   Minimum Required: 70.0

ðŸ“ˆ Component Scores:
   âœ“ Coverage: 82.1%
   âœ“ Relationships: 71.5%
   âœ— Rights: 68.9%
   âœ“ Retrieval: 79.2%

ðŸŽ¯ Maturity Level: M5 - Embeddings Complete

âœ… READY FOR STAGE 8: Autogenerated Deliverables
```

### 2. Identify Gaps

```bash
# Generate detailed gap analysis
rails enliterator:literacy:gaps[batch_123]

# Output:
ðŸ“‹ GAP ANALYSIS REPORT
Summary:
  Total Issues: 145
  Critical Gaps: 2
  Overall Severity: HIGH

Orphaned entities:
  Count: 23
  Severity: medium

Missing canonicals:
  Count: 45
  Severity: high

ðŸŽ¯ Prioritized Actions:
1. [HIGH] Generate canonical names for 45 entities
2. [MEDIUM] Connect 23 orphaned entities to the graph
3. [LOW] Add temporal data for 77 entities
```

### 3. Generate Full Report

```bash
# Create comprehensive report with all metrics
rails enliterator:literacy:report[batch_123]

# Saves JSON report to:
# tmp/literacy_reports/batch_123_full_report.json
```

### 4. Test Implementation

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
rails runner script/test_literacy_scoring.rb

# With verbose output
VERBOSE=true rails runner script/test_literacy_scoring.rb

# Save test results
SAVE_RESULTS=true rails runner script/test_literacy_scoring.rb
```

## Integration with Pipeline

### Prerequisites (Stages 1-6)
- âœ… IngestBatch created (Stage 1)
- âœ… Rights assigned (Stage 2)
- âœ… Lexicon extracted (Stage 3)
- âœ… Entities identified (Stage 4)
- âœ… Graph assembled (Stage 5)
- âœ… Embeddings generated (Stage 6)

### Next Steps (Stage 8)
Once Enliteracy Score â‰¥70:
1. Generate prompt packs
2. Create evaluation bundles
3. Determine refresh cadence
4. Export deliverables

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Neo4j queries use indices where available
- Batch operations for large datasets
- Caching of expensive calculations
- Progress reporting for long operations

### Scalability
- Handles graphs with 10k+ nodes
- Pagination for large result sets
- Configurable timeouts
- Background job processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Score Below Threshold**
   - Review gap analysis report
   - Address critical gaps first
   - Focus on lowest-scoring components
   - Re-run after improvements

2. **Neo4j Connection Errors**
   - Ensure Neo4j is running: `docker-compose up neo4j`
   - Check connection settings in config/initializers/neo4j.rb
   - Verify batch data exists in graph

3. **Missing Prerequisites**
   - Run test script to check all stages
   - Complete any missing stages
   - Verify data integrity

## Conclusion

Stage 7 is fully implemented and operational. The literacy scoring system provides comprehensive analysis of the knowledge graph's completeness and quality. Batches achieving a score â‰¥70 are ready to proceed to Stage 8 for generating deliverables.

The implementation follows the spec requirements exactly and provides detailed insights into the dataset's "literacy" - its ability to converse meaningfully about its content through the why, how, and what's next of the data relationships.
