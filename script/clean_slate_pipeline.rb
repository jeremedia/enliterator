# Next Steps
puts "\n" + "="*80

puts "="*80

puts <<~STEPS
  1. Fix identified bugs:
     - IngestItem error_message ‚Üí triage_error
     - Neo4j transaction separation
     - Database creation before use
     - Extraction/rights processing
  
  2. Create Meta-Enliterator bundle:
     rails runner 'MetaEnliteration::BundleCreator.new.call'
  
  3. Run ONE pipeline:
     rails runner script/create_meta_enliterator.rb
  
  4. Verify success:
     - All 9 stages complete
     - Literacy score > 70
     - Can answer questions about Enliterator
  
  Remember: The Meta-Enliterator must be BORN, not assembled.
